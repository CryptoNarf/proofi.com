Each plan includes a numerical range of data with limits to each plan. You will select your Plan as part of your registration for the Proofi Site, which may begin with a Beta Trial. Each subscription period for a Plan will be month to month. You may choose to be billed for the Plan annually or in less than annual increments (e.g. monthly), but regardless of your billing cycle, you are responsible for subscription fees for each month which will be billed to the card you subscribed with.</p><p>To view the specific details of your Plan, including pricing information and the end date of your subscription period, sign into your account and visit the account management page.</p><h3>Billing Policies, Refunds, Overages, and Upgrade and Downgrade Terms</h3><p>The fees for your Plan are billed in advance of each billing cycle. In the event you cancel your Plan, no refunds or credits will be provided for partial or unused months of the Proofi Site. You will not be charged any overage fees if you exceed the maximum number of recorded data allowed by your Plan in any one given month. However, if you exceed your Plan’s data limits for two consecutive months, you will be automatically upgraded to a subscription with a higher data limit than your current Plan. If you are on a monthly billing cycle, you will be charged for your upgraded Plan starting with the next applicable month after the upgrade. If you are not billed monthly, at the next applicable month after the upgrade, you will be charged for the increased price of the upgraded Plan, pro-rated to reflect the remaining duration of your subscription period. In either case, you will be at this upgraded Plan for the remainder of your subscription period.</p><h3>Beta Trial</h3><p>Subscriptions to the Proofi Site may begin with a free trial period during which you can try out the Beta for 2 months from the date you register. There is no limit to the amount of Data recorded on a registered website during the Beta Period. You may cancel your Plan at any time during the Beta Period by following the steps described in the “account cancellation” section. Upon cancelling your account, you may lose access to some data. Proofi reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit the Beta Period without notice at any time.</p><h3>Changes in Fees</h3><p>We may change the fees for the Site at any time or impose additional fees or charges. Such changes will be effective as of the first billing cycle that occurs more than thirty (30) days after notice of our new fees or plan changes.</p><h3>Payment of Fees</h3><p>As an express condition of your use of and access to the Proofi reporting, you agree to pay all fees applicable to your Plan, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Proofi Site. We will bill the fees due under your Plan to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your payment information). You acknowledge that the amount billed for each renewal period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your Plan, and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to bill you the corresponding amounts. We reserve the right to deactivate your access to the Proofi Site for failure to pay applicable fees as described in this Agreement. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are stated in U.S. Dollars.</p><h3>Credit Card Payments</h3><p>All fees for your Plan will be billed to your credit card. You authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and associated with your Plan and authorize us (or a billing agent acting on our behalf) to continue charging all such amounts to your credit card account until you or we cancel or terminate your Plan as provided herein or these amounts are paid in full, whichever is later. You must provide current, complete and accurate billing and credit card information. You must promptly update all billing information (such as billing address, card number and expiration date) to keep your account current, complete and accurate, and you must promptly contact Proofi if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if you become aware of a potential breach of account security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your Proofi username or password).</p><p>You authorize us to obtain or determine updated or replacement expiration dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve the right to charge any renewal card issued to you to the same extent as the expired card. If payment is not received from your credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Please check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.</p><h3>Account Cancellation</h3><p>You may cancel your Plan by logging into account management or emailing us <a href="mailto:support@proofi.com">support@proofi.com</a>. If you cancel your Plan, you may lose some access, upon the expiration of your current pre-paid period, to the Site and any data or information stored in your account.</p></div></div></div><div class="columns has-margin-top-40"><div class="column"><div class="content is-medium"><div class="tags has-addons"><span class="tag">These Terms of Use has been updated on </span><span class="tag is-primary">09-12-2019</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered"><div class="column is-narrow is-centered"><picture class="image"><img src="/assets/logo/proofi-inverted.svg" width="154px" class="lazy"></picture><div class="content is-medium has-margin-top-40"><p class="subtitle is-6 is-spaced has-text-centered has-text-white">From the makers of <a href="https://www.ltonetwork.com">LTO Network</a>, <a href="https://www.fillthedoc.com">FillTheDoc</a> and <a href="https://www.firm24.com/bv-oprichten/">Firm24</a></p><p class="subtitle is-7 is-spaced has-text-white"><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a> - <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a> - <a href="/cookies/">Cookie Statement</a></p></div></div></div></div></footer><script>window.lazyLoadOptions = { elements_selector: ".lazy" };</script><script src="/js/main.js"></script><script>!function(a,b,c,d,t){var e,f=a.getElementsByTagName("head")[0];if(!a.getElementById(c)){if(e=a.createElement(b),e.id=c,e.setAttribute("data-vrlps-ucid",d),e.setAttribute("data-vrlps-version","2"), e.setAttribute("data-vrlps-template", t),e.src="https://app.viral-loops.com/popup_assets/js/vl_load_v2.min.js",window.ub){jQuery=null,$=null;var g=a.createElement(b);g.src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js",f.appendChild(g)}f.appendChild(e);var h=a.createElement("link");h.rel="stylesheet",h.type="text/css",h.href="https://app.viral-loops.com/static/vl-loader.css",f.appendChild(h);var i=a.createElement("div");i.id="vl-overlay",i.style.display="none";var j=a.createElement("div");j.id="vl-loader",i.appendChild(j),a.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(b){a.body.appendChild(i);for(var c=a.getElementsByClassName("vrlps-trigger"),d=0;d<c.length;d++)c[d].removeAttribute("href"),c[d].onclick=function(){a.getElementById("vl-overlay").style.display="block"};var e=a.querySelectorAll("[data-vl-widget='popupTrigger']");[].forEach.call(e,function(b){var c=a.createElement("div");c.className="vl-embedded-cta-loader",b.appendChild(c)})})}}(document,"script","vrlps-js","D4AUCGi5GhsMJ0LyzBmVvPckORE","waitlist");</script><!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-62115237-5"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
